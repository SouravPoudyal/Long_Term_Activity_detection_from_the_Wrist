# Long Term Activity detection from the Wrist
## Intrduction
In this project, activity recognition of players playing basketball is performed using Deep convolution LSTM to classify the actions namely dribbling,layup, shot, pass and rebound in basketball class, and for Running, Walking, Standing and Sitting in the locomotion class.The data is collected from wearable sensors, for 12 subjects. Leave one subject out technique is implemented to cross validate the results with 11 subjects used in training and one for cross validation.
